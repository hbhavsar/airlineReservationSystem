###Airline Reservation System

To start, you need to have the airline database running on your system.

Download the java files into your source folder. The Server-Client connection is multithreaded however, the Server-Backend connection is single threaded. I am working on a multithreaded version with a two-phase commit protocol.

1. Run Backend
2. Run Server
3. Run Client
4. Execute commands from the client; logout
5. Close Server
6. Close Backend
